description: Make App Store-style screenshots and a short demo video of this iOS app running in the Simulator, using only Xcode's xcrun simctl (no installs needed), with optional framing and video editing when the app-store-screenshots, screenshot-automation or remotion-best-practices skills and Node.js are available. Use when the user asks for screenshots, a demo video, an app preview, or showcase material.

# App demo media

Written for the BRI x Swift Bali workshop (Oct 2026). Reply to the user in Bahasa Indonesia. Headlines on screenshots are in Bahasa Indonesia.

Output: 3 screenshots of the key moments of the main user flow, and one 20 to 30 second demo video of the same flow.

## Rules

- Dummy data only. Never show real names, account numbers or customer data, including in recordings.
- Do not upload anything to App Store Connect or any other service.
- Do not install global tools (`npm -g`, `brew`, `pip`) yourself. Name the command and let the user run it.
- Do not change app code, except dummy data or a screenshot-only launch argument, and ask first.

## 0. If you cannot run shell commands

Agents inside Xcode can only run commands the user has allowed (Xcode › Settings › Intelligence › Permissions › Allowed Commands). If `xcrun` is refused: stop, tell the user in one line to add `xcrun`, `mkdir` and `mdls` there, and wait. Do not look for another way to record. If the user cannot allow it, fall back to: run the app with Xcode tools, walk the flow with `DeviceInteraction` or MobileBuildMCP, and ask the user to press the record button and the screenshot button in the Simulator window (Device Hub) while you drive the flow; then write the report in section 5 with the files the user saved.

## 1. Prepare

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `userflow.md` to find the main flow (for example: buat tagihan > pilih teman > kirim pengingat).
2. Find or boot a simulator. Use the one already booted from the last Xcode run; otherwise prefer the newest iPhone Pro in the list (iPhone 17 Pro or 18 Pro, 1206 x 2622, accepted by the App Store without resizing).

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices booted
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 17 Pro"   # only if none is booted; use the newest iPhone Pro name from `xcrun simctl list devices available`
```

3. Build and run the app on that simulator (Xcode MCP tools, MobileBuildMCP, the `run-simulator` skill, or `xcodebuild`). If the build fails, stop and report the first error.
4. Clean the status bar and fix the appearance:

```bash
xcrun simctl status_bar booted override --time 9:41 \
  --dataNetwork wifi --wifiMode active --wifiBars 3 \
  --cellularMode active --cellularBars 4 \
  --batteryState charged --batteryLevel 100 --operatorName ""
xcrun simctl ui booted appearance light
```

## 2. Navigate the flow with real tools

Use the accessibility tree, not guessed coordinates. In order of preference:

- Xcode's own device interaction tools (built in for agents inside Xcode; they tap, read the screen and take screenshots)

- MobileBuildMCP tools `snapshot_ui`, `tap`, `type_text`, `screenshot` (skill `mobilebuildmcp`). If it fails because `xcode-select` points to CommandLineTools, do not change it (that needs sudo); use Xcode's tools instead
- the `agent-device` CLI (skill `ios-simulator`), if the user has installed it
- an XCUITest UI test that walks the flow (skill `flow-walkthrough` or `screenshot-automation`)

If an element has no accessibility label and you have to guess, tell the user. That is a real accessibility finding.

## 3. Screenshots

```bash
mkdir -p marketing/raw marketing/framed marketing/video
xcrun simctl io booted screenshot --type=png marketing/raw/01-<momen>.png
```

Take 3 screenshots at the three most important moments. Open and look at every image. Retake if it shows an empty state by accident, an error, a loading spinner, or the keyboard covering content.

Framing (pick what is available):

- **Skill `app-store-screenshots`** (Node.js 20.9+): device frame, headline, export at official sizes.
- **Skill `screenshot-automation`**: Swift-only pipeline with captions and frames.
- **Neither available**: deliver the raw screenshots plus a proposed headline for each. Do not fake a frame.

Headlines: at most 5 words, sell the benefit, not the feature name. Example: "Tagih teman tanpa canggung", not "Fitur Split Bill".

## 4. Demo video

Walk the flow once without recording first, so you know every step. Then relaunch the app on the first screen and record. Start the recorder only when the next tool call is the first tap: a long idle start makes the video too long.

Record the same flow from the start, with short pauses on each screen:

```bash
xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo --codec=h264 --force marketing/video/demo-raw.mov &
REC=$!
sleep 1
# ... run the flow with the navigation tool ...
kill -INT "$REC"    # same as Ctrl+C; the file is only complete after this
wait "$REC"
```

Aim for 20 to 30 seconds. Check the duration (`mdls -name kMDItemDurationSeconds marketing/video/demo-raw.mov` on macOS). If it is much longer, record again with fewer pauses rather than cutting the flow.

Optional editing, only if available:

- **Remotion** (skill `remotion-best-practices`, Node.js): composition 886 x 1920, 30 fps, 2-second title card, the recording, a closing card with the app name. Render to `marketing/video/demo-final.mp4`. Remotion is free for evaluation; companies above 3 employees need a licence for real work.
- **ffmpeg** (if already installed) for resizing to App Store preview size:

```bash
ffmpeg -i marketing/video/demo-raw.mov -vf "scale=886:1920,fps=30" \
  -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -an marketing/video/demo-886x1920.mp4
```

If neither is available, `demo-raw.mov` is the deliverable. If it is longer than 30 seconds, do not install anything: tell the user to trim it in QuickTime Player (open the file, Edit › Trim or ⌘T, drag the yellow handles, Save) and give the start and end second to keep.

## 5. Clean up and report

```bash
xcrun simctl status_bar booted clear
```

Report in Bahasa Indonesia:

```
File: marketing/raw/..., marketing/framed/..., marketing/video/...
Headline: 1) ... 2) ... 3) ...
Durasi video: .. detik
Yang gagal atau dilewati: ...
Catatan aksesibilitas: <elemen tanpa label, kalau ada>
```

Remind the user: the agent checked what is visible; whether the flow feels fast, clear and natural is for a human to judge.
